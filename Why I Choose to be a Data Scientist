A data scientist is an analytics professional who performs the tasks of gathering, analyzing, and interpreting data to aid in decision-making in an organization. Data science is a growing field revolutionizing how governments, businesses, and organizations uncover insights, comprehend patterns, and leverage data to perform better. It is an ever-growing field in demand and offers excellent job security. These are many reasons I choose to be a data scientist. The profession has become a significant aspect of my professional journey. The topic selected on why I choose to be a data scientist is focused on my personal decision to transition from a career in Civil engineering. This is an important post to share as it pinpoints the transformative power of data science in different industries. Also, the post offers motivations behind such career shifts.

The decision to be a Data Scientist
	I found myself profoundly fascinated by the potential of data-driven decision-making after I had completed my bachelor's degree in civil engineering and worked as a field engineer and construction manager to gain 10 years of experience in the field. While accomplishing my tasks, I remained updated on the progressive advancements in technology worldwide and the heightened dependence on data in different fields. While still working in the engineering and construction field, I realized that data dependence was increasing in these and other fields, and there was a need for individuals who would analyze and extract valuable insights from the data. I had a great desire to expand my skill set, which made me embark on a journey to study and acquire knowledge in data science. I attended workshops and enrolled in an online class where I learned different concepts of programming languages such as Python, machine language, and statistics. I decided to acquire more knowledge and skills in data science, which was motivated by its expansive possibilities in informed decision-making and problem-solving. 
I choose to become a data scientist due to data's immense power to aid decision-making. As a civil engineer, I used limited data, experience, and intuition to make decisions. With time, I realized I could make more accurate decisions by incorporating data. By exploring a journey in data science, I would be able to collect and analyze data that would help me make more informed decisions leading to better outcomes in my engineering projects. 
Moreover, as a data scientist, I would easily tackle the complex problems experienced in construction and engineering projects. As a civil engineer, I realized that the problems faced in the construction and engineering fields require innovative solutions, which can be acquired by applying predictive analytics and machine modeling, among other data science concepts. Also, I knew that the world was rapidly evolving, and embracing data science would ensure that I stayed at the forefront of technological advancements in my engineering field.

The decision to become a data scientist was fueled by different factors, including the need to embrace technological advancements, the potential for making more informed decisions, and transformative problem-solving. After transitioning to a data scientist, I have made more informed decisions and solved problems by leveraging the power of data. Data science has become a pivotal discipline in todayâ€™s data-driven world, and many professionals can leverage its benefits.
